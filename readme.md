This is a personal project of mine to create a better, more interactive way of comparing Javascript graphing libraries.

Roadmap:
* Host on S3 bucket
* Add more chart types
* Add more charting libraries
* Add more library specific options
* Add real data from open dataset
* Add editable source code
* Add personal notes on each library
